1. About skipping a question: in my old cookie script, this is a little extra feature (clicking the "Next question" button just gives you 0 points). 
   Of course, cheating by setting the cookie to a higher value (manually) could be possible (the same holds true for changing the score)! Changing 
   the score in-between questions was possible with the more "naive" version of my second homework, just by reloading the page and submitting it 
   again: this kept on increasing the score (I tried to fix it, as you might remember).
2. Cheating by changing a cookie isn't possible anymore. Now all the data is stored in the PHP $_SESSION array, so unless you're able to access that
   array, it's not possible to change the score/question number (look at $_SESSION["submitted"] too, which is a flag that checks if a question has 
   already been submitted somewhere in the past).
